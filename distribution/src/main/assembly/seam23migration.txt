Seam 2.3 Migration Guide
========================
Before you get started with Seam 2.3, there are a few things you should be aware
of. This process should not be too painful - if you get stuck, just refer back
to the updated Seam examples.

This migration guide assumes you are using Seam 2.2, if you are migrating from
Seam 1.2 or 2.0, see the seam2migration.txt and seam21migration.txt guide as well.


Testing
-------

SeamTest and JBoss Embedded is legacy components and have many limitations and we doesn't support it now.
We now bring Arquillian as a replacement of JBoss Embedded and integration testing 
is provided by org.jboss.seam.mock.JUnitSeamTest, dbunit testing is provided by org.jboss.seam.mock.DBJUnitSeamTest.
More due some issues with TestNG in Arquillian, we use JUnit as prefered test framework. Migration to Junit and
Arquillian goes in the following steps:
1. Add @RunWith(Arquillian.class) annotation to your test class.
2. Your test class should extend JUnitSeamTest instead of SeamTest.
3. Add a helper class for instance like
examples/booking/booking-tests/src/test/java/org/jboss/seam/example/booking/test/Deployments.java
4. Add a method like public static org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.Archive<?> createDeployment(){} for creating deployment
archive for Arquillian environment with annotations
@Deployment(name="<your_test_name>") and @OverProtocol("Servlet 3.0") 
5. Add arquillian.xml file into root of your classpath for running test(s). The file content should specify path to
remote or managed container and some specific options for JVM or Arquillian. Example of arquillian file is at
examples/booking/booking-tests/src/test/resources-integration/arquillian.xml.
More details in Seam reference documentation guide in chapter 37. Testing Seam applications.

Schemas
----------------

XML schemas for validation Files that use the Seam 2.2 XSDs should be updated to refer to 
the 2.3 XSDs. Current Schemas URL is www.jboss.org/schema/seam/<schema>-2.3.xsd.

Bean Validation instead of Hibernate Validator
------------------

You need to migrate from org.hibernate.validator.* validator annotations to java.validation.constraint.* equivalent
for instance:
org.hibernate.validator.Length to java.validation.constraint.Size,
org.hibernate.validator.NotNull to java.validation.constraint.NotNull,
org.hibernate.validator.Pattern to java.validation.constraint.Pattern.

JSF 1 to JSF 2 Facelets
------------------

Configuration file faces-config.xml is not required to be in your application, if you anyway would like to have it,
change version to 2.1.

All your application JSF templates should use only facelets technology.

Here it is required to convert <head>/<body> tags to <h:head><h:body>


Java EE 6 upgrade
-----------------

Seam 2.3 can integrate with the major upgrades in Java EE (from 5 to 6). You can use persistence with JPA 2, EJB 3.1 and
Bean Validation.

Using JPA 2 requires to change version to 2.0 in your persistence.xml file. Version in application.xml should be 6.
Migration of web.xml file is in changing version to 3.0.

Examples of changed headers with versions are the following.

persistence.xml:
<persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd" 
    version="2.0">

application.xml:
<application xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/application_6.xsd"
    version="6">

web.xml:
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0">

Further JNDI string creation changed due Java EE 6 JNDI portable syntax, and you have to change all JNDI strings from
<your_application>/#{ejbName}/local to java:app/<application-module-name>/#{ejbName} like
 for instance in WEB-INF/components.xml change jndiPattern from: seam-mail/#{ejbName}/local to java:app/seam-mail-ejb/#{ejbName}

JBoss AS 7.1 deployment
--------------------------

If you using for development or testing default datasource in JBoss AS 7.1, change jndi string in your persistence.xml
from  java:/DefaultDS to java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS.

JBoss AS 7 has got refactored classloading and specific classloading of bundled or provided libraries can be managed in 
jboss-deployment-structure.xml, which should be placed in META-INF directory of your application. Minimal content for
Seam 2.3 based application is:
<jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.0">
  <deployment>
  	  <dependencies>
         <module name="org.dom4j" export="true"/>
         <module name="org.apache.commons.collections" export="true"/>
	      <module name="javax.faces.api" export="true"/> <!-- keep there only if you use JSF as view technology -->
	    </dependencies>
  </deployment>  
</jboss-deployment-structure>
More details are described in JBoss AS 7 documentation.



Dependency changes (Maven)
--------------------------

The "provided" platform is now JBoss AS 7.1.x, therefore all Java EE dependencies included
in AS 7 are now marked as provided. Seam uses JBoss Java EE BOM files through Seam BOM file for declaring dependencies.
You should add import of org.jboss.seam:bom only and then just use the dependency groupId:artifactId[:scope] wherever in
your maven project.

<dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.jboss.seam</groupId>
                <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
                <version>2.3.0.CR1</version>
                <type>pom</type>
                <scope>import</scope>
            </dependency>

         ...
      </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>


<dependencies>

   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jboss.seam</groupId>
      <artifactId>jboss-seam</artifactId>
      <type>ejb</type>
   <dependency>

   ...
</dependencies>
