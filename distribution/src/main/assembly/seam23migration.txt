Seam 2.3 Migration Guide
========================
Before you get started with Seam 2.3, there are a few things you should be aware
of. This process should not be too painful - if you get stuck, just refer back
to the updated Seam examples.

This migration guide assumes you are using Seam 2.0, if you are migrating from
Seam 1.2, see the seam2migration guide as well.


Testing
-------

SeamTest and JBoss Embedded is legacy components and have many limitations and we doesn't support it now.
We now bring Arquillian as a replacement of JBoss Embedded and integration testing 
is provided by org.jboss.seam.mock.JUnitSeamTest. More in reference documentation guide.

Schemas
----------------
XML schemas for validation Files that use the Seam 2.2 XSDs should be updated to refer to 
the 2.3 XSDs. Current Schemas URL is www.jboss.org/schema/seam/<schema>-2.3.xsd.

Bean Validation
------------------
You need to migrate from org.hibernate.validator.* validator annotations to java.validation.constraint.* equivalent
for instance:
org.hibernate.validator.Length to java.validation.constraint.Size,
org.hibernate.validator.NotNull to java.validation.constraint.NotNull,
org.hibernate.validator.Pattern to java.validation.constraint.Pattern.


Dependency changes (Maven)
--------------------------

The "provided" platform is now JBoss AS 7.1.x, therefore all Java EE dependencies included
in AS 7 are now marked as provided.

Seam UI tags
--------------------------
We use Richfaces CDK for generation of Seam UI taglib, unfortunately Richfaces CDK 4 doesn't support to create custom tags for converter or validator:
Affected seam tags are: 
    convertEntity
    convertEnum
    convertAtomicBoolean
    convertAtomicInteger
    convertAtomicLong
    validateFormattedText
There can be used standard JSF 2 tags like f:converter or f:validator for the simulating the old behaviour of s:convert* or s:validate* tags.
