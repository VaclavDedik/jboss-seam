  <title>Getting started with Seam, using seam-gen</title>
  <para>
    The Seam distribution includes a command line utility that makes
    it really easy to set up an Eclipse project, generate some simple
    Seam skeleton code, and reverse engineer an application from a
    pre-existing database.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    This is the easy way to get your feet wet with Seam, and gives
    you some ammunition for next time you find yourself trapped in
    an elevator with one of those tedious Ruby guys ranting about 
    how great and wonderful his new toy is for building totally 
    trivial applications that put things in databases.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    In this release, seam-gen works best for people with JBoss AS. 
    You can use the generated project with other J2EE or Java EE 5
    application servers by making a few manual changes to the 
    project configuration.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    You <emphasis>can</emphasis> use seam-gen without Eclipse, but in
    this tutorial, we want to show you how to use it in conjunction
    with Eclipse for debugging and integration testing. If you don't
    want to install Eclipse, you can still follow along with this 
    tutorial&mdash;all steps can be peformed from the command line.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Seam-gen is basically just a big ugly Ant script wrapped around
    Hibernate Tools, together with some templates. Which means it is 
    easy to customize if you need to.
  </para>
  
  <section>
    <title>Before you start</title>
  
    <para>
      Make sure you have JDK 5 or JDK 6, JBoss AS 4.0.5 and Ant 1.6, along 
      with recent versions of Eclipse, the JBoss IDE plugin for Eclipse and 
      the TestNG plugin for Eclipse correctly installed before starting. Add 
      your JBoss installation to the JBoss Server View in Eclipse. Start JBoss 
      in debug mode. Finally, start a command prompt in the directory where you 
      unzipped the Seam distribution.
    </para>
    
    <para>
            JBoss has sophisticated support for hot re-deployment of WARs
            and EARs. Unfortunately, due to bugs in the JVM, repeated
            redeployment of an EAR&mdash;which is common during 
            development&mdash;eventually causes the JVM to run out of perm 
            gen space. For this reason, we recommend running JBoss in a JVM 
            with a large perm gen space at development time. If you're running
            JBoss from JBoss IDE, you can configure this in the server
            launch configuration, under "VM arguments". We suggest the 
            following values:
    </para>
        
        <programlisting>-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512</programlisting>
        
    <para>
            If you don't have so much memory available, the following is
            our minimum recommendation:
    </para>

        <programlisting>-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256</programlisting>
        
    <para>
            If you're running JBoss from the commandline, you can configure 
            the JVM options in <literal>bin/run.conf</literal>.
    </para>
    
    <para>
            If you don't want to bother with this stuff now, you don't have 
            to&mdash;come back to it later, when you get your first 
            <literal>OutOfMemoryException</literal>.

    <title>Setting up a new Eclipse project</title>
    
    <para>
        The first thing we need to do is configure seam-gen for your
        environment: JBoss AS installation directory, Eclipse workspace,
        and database connection. It's easy, just type:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>cd jboss-seam-1.1.x
seam setup</programlisting>

    <para>
        And you will be prompted for the needed information:

    <para>
      The most important choice you need to make is between EAR deployment and WAR
      deployment of your project. EAR projects support EJB 3.0 and require Java EE 5.
      WAR projects do not support EJB 3.0, but may be deployed to a J2EE environment.
      The packaging of a WAR is also simpler to understand. If you installed JBoss
      with the ejb3 profile, choose <literal>ear</literal>. Otherwise, choose
      <literal>war</literal>. We'll assume that you've chosen an EAR deployment for 
      the rest of the tutorial, but you can follow exactly the same steps for a
      WAR deployment.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
      If you are working with an existing data model, make sure you tell seam-gen that
      the tables already exist in the database.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The settings are stored in <literal>seam-gen/build.properties</literal>, but you
      can also modify them simply by running <literal>seam setup</literal> a second
      time.

      Now we can create a new project in our Eclipse workspace directory, by typing:

      This copies the Seam jars, dependent jars and the JDBC driver jar to a new Eclipse
      project, and generates all needed resources and configuration files, a facelets
      template file and stylesheet, along with Eclipse metadata and an Ant build script. 
      The Eclipse project will be automatically deployed to an exploded directory structure 
      in JBoss AS as soon as you add the project using 
      <literal>New -> Project... -> Java Project -> Next</literal>, typing the 
      <literal>Project name</literal> (<literal>myproject</literal> in this case),
      selecting your Java SE 5 or Java SE 6 JRE and then clicking <literal>Finish</literal>.

      Don't get scared by the XML configuration documents that were generated into the
      project directory. They are mostly standard Java EE stuff, the stuff you need to 
      create once and then never look at again, and they are 90% the same between all 
      Seam projects. (They are so easy to write that even seam-gen can do it.)
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The generated project includes three database and persistence configurations.
      The <literal>jboss-beans.xml</literal>, <literal>persistence-test.xml</literal>

      unit tests against HSQLDB. The database schema and the test data in 
      <literal>import-test.sql</literal> is always exported to the database before 
      running tests. The <literal>myproject-dev-ds.xml</literal>, 
      <literal>persistence-dev.xml</literal>and <literal>import-dev.sql</literal>
      files are for use when deploying the application to your development database.
      The schema might be exported automatically at deployment, depending upon 
      whether you told seam-gen that you are working with an existing database.
      The <literal>myproject-prod-ds.xml</literal>, 
      <literal>persistence-prod.xml</literal>and <literal>import-prod.sql</literal>
      files are for use when deploying the application to your production database.

      Because we've added a new Seam component, we need to restart the exploded

      or by running the <literal>restart</literal> target in the generated project 
      <literal>build.xml</literal> file from inside Eclipse. Another way to force
      a restart is to edit the file <literal>resources/META-INF/application.xml</literal>

      by running <literal>seam unexplode</literal>. To deploy the EAR, we
      can type <literal>seam deploy</literal> at the command prompt, or 
      run the <literal>deploy</literal> target of the generated project

      By default, the application will be deployed with the

      files, and the <literal>myproject-dev-ds.xml</literal> file
      will be deployed. You can change the profile, and use the
