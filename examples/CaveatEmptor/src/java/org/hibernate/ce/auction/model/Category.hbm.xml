Mapping file for the Category class of CaveatEmptor.

Categories are versioned and we make some use of the
DirectSetAccessor for immutable properties and properties
that are covered with convenience methods that protect
entity relationships (setChildren() vs. addChildren()).

Interesting is the bidirectional one-to-many association
that references parent and child categories. This is a
real parent/child association, with full cascading
enabled.

There can never be two categories with the same name at
the same "level", that is, they can't have the same parent
category. This is protected with a unique constraint.

		This is an alternative mapping for the many-to-many association
		to Item. We use an intermediate class, CategorizedItem, that
		represents the link (However, it is a value type in this case,
		the packaged CategorizedItem class will not work!)

		You can use this mapping style if your association table has
		additional columns. In our case, we have the USERNAME and
		DATE_ADDED column. These are also properties of the
		CategorizedItem class. The many-to-many association we created
		here is only accessible from the Category side. Items can't
		access CategorizedItem, it is mapped as a non-shared component
		of Category.

		In addition to a composite element mapping, we also use an idbag.
		This means we'd like to have a surrogate primary key for the link
		table. Unfortunately, Hibernate doesn't support the "native" ID
		generator for collection identifiers at the time of writing.
		Replace "increment" with a database specific id generator,
		otherwise your application will not cluster-safe!

		If we would use a set or standard bag, the primary key of the
		association table would be all columns. Keep in mind that all
		columns of the link table would have to be not null. The idbag
		allows us to have nullable columns. If you use this mapping, you
		will have to change the type of the property in Category from Set
		to List.

		You can also make the username property a real many-to-one
		association to User.
